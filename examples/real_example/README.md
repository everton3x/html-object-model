# Html Object Model

In this example, we demonstrate a useful way to use the Html Object Model to build a graphical user interface for the web.

Basically, we created a web page with a login form.

Read the comments in the code and study the example that you will realize how powerful the Html Object Model can be.

To see this example working, you can use the build-in PHP server (at the root of the project):

```sh
php -S localhost:8080
```

After starting the PHP server, access this adress in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/examples/real_example/login.php
```
