# How to contribute
If you want to contribute to the project, make a fork, create a branch for each feature or correction, submit a pull request and wait for my return.

**Please, before sending a pull request, make sure your code goes through Github Action Code Quality. In the `bin` directory you will find the scripts to verify this.**

**Don't forget to use PHPUnit tests before submitting your code and, if you add features, please include tests for them.**
